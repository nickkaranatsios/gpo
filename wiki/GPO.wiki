= Google Pose Optimizer =

The Google pose optimizer (GPO) allows reconstruction of the pose of a sensor platform (i.e. its position and orientation) based on information from sensors such as GPS, accelerometers and rate gyroscopes.

The traditional way to solve this problem is to use a Kalman filter, which will give you the  pose in real time. GPO uses an off-line optimization approach pioneered by James Diebel at Stanford ([http://ai.stanford.edu/~diebel/smoother.html His software is here]). The advantage of off-line optimization is that smoother and more accurate results are produced.

GPO had a sensor plugin architecture that allows new sensor models to be easily incorporated in to the optimization. The sensor models currently supported are:
  * GPS position and doppler velocity.
  * Accelerometers.
  * Rate gyroscopes.
  * Wheel encoders.
  * Simple road constraint models.
